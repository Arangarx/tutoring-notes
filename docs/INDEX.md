## Docs cleanup / archival policy

On every docs-cleanup pass: **archive** anything verified to be captured elsewhere or later superseded/overridden — but **never** archive information that would be lost if it's still valid and unique.

Bar to archive a doc or section: **(a)** its still-valid content is provably captured in a canonical consolidated doc, **or** **(b)** it's been explicitly superseded. If removing it would lose valid unique information, **keep it**. Goal: reduce docs sprawl without losing signal.

**Canonical pattern:** consolidate scattered feedback into one source, verify capture, **then** archive the redundant copies. Open work lives in [docs/BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md); historical material in the Archive section below.

---

## Archive

[`docs/archive/`](archive/) is **cold storage** — superseded or captured-elsewhere docs; not authoritative. [`docs/archive/ARCHIVE-LEDGER.md`](archive/ARCHIVE-LEDGER.md) is the audit trail. Agents ignore this tree by default (`.cursorindexingignore`). When an INDEX row used to point at an archived doc, check the ledger or BACKLOG for where that info now lives.

**Cursor plans:** tutoring-notes plan files archived to `~/.cursor/plans/archive/`; canonical sequencing = [docs/RELEASE-ROADMAP.md](RELEASE-ROADMAP.md) + [docs/BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md).
