# Andrew follow-ups — drop-in checklist

> **For you when you’re back after a gap.** Agents keep this current. Code work continues without waiting on these unless a row says “blocks code.”

**Last refreshed:** 2026-09-15  
**Canonical priorities:** [`docs/BACKLOG.md`](../BACKLOG.md) § Release priorities (option B)

## Do these when you have 15–30 minutes (Google Console)

These are **Andrew-only** (no agent can finish them). They do **not** block the Sign-in-with-Google UI code chunk.

| # | Action | Why | Blocks code? |
|---|--------|-----|--------------|
| 1 | Open [OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) — note status (Testing / In production) and whether `gmail.send` is still verified | Confirms we can ship Sign-In + plan calendar verify | No |
| 2 | Confirm redirect URIs include `{host}/api/auth/callback/google` for **prod** (`usemynk.com`) and **localhost** (and any preview hosts you care about) | Sign-In button will 302 to Google; bad URI → `oauth_error` on `/login` | No for UI merge; **yes for live Sign-In smoke** |
| 3 | Confirm `{host}/api/auth/gmail/callback` still listed (existing Gmail connect) | Don’t break Sarah’s Gmail | No |
| 4 | [Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) — `usemynk.com` verified? Branding re-submit if pending ([`LEGAL-SYNC.md`](../LEGAL-SYNC.md)) | Needed before bundled calendar verification | No |
| 5 | **Add** `{host}/api/auth/calendar/callback` (prod + localhost) — **do not submit verification yet** | Agents are wiring Calendar connect (scopes only; sync stubbed) so this URI will be live | No for code; **yes for live Calendar connect smoke** |
| 6 | Enable **Google Calendar API** on the Mortensen Apps client. Add scopes `calendar.events` + `calendar.readonly` to the consent screen. **Submit ONE bundled verification** only after the Connect-Calendar demo is on a crawlable URL (honest stub is enough — no two-way sync required for the screencast) | Andrew 2026-08-14: **one re-verify only** when scopes change | Yes for Google review submit |

**Paste status here when done** (agents will fold into BACKLOG/STATE):

```
Consent screen: 
gmail.send verified?: 
Sign-in callback URIs OK?: 
Search Console usemynk.com?: 
Notes:
```

## Tutor email allowlist — add pilot emails in operator UI (Andrew-only)

Pre-approved signup allowlist is coded on `feat/auth-ship-ready`. **Do not seed Sarah/Tyson emails from the repo** — after merge, add their real addresses on [`/admin/tutor-approvals`](/admin/tutor-approvals) under **Pre-approved emails**. They still confirm email (unless Google) and still set up 2FA; allowlist only skips the waitlist.

| # | Action | Why | Blocks code? |
|---|--------|-----|--------------|
| 1 | Add Sarah + Tyson emails via operator UI | Skip waitlist for pilot tutors | No — mergeable without this |

---

## SMS 2FA (Twilio) — code shipped, needs your account + env (Andrew-only)

SMS OTP two-factor auth is **fully coded** on `feat/auth-ship-ready` (enroll, login verify, step-up, change-method) but is **fail-closed until you provision Twilio** — no agent can do this part.

| # | Action | Why | Blocks code? |
|---|--------|-----|--------------|
| 1 | Create/confirm a Twilio account + buy a Programmable SMS-capable number | Source number for outbound OTP texts | No — SMS card stays disabled until done |
| 2 | Set `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` on the Vercel env for the target deployment (see `.env.example`) | `isSms2faEnrollmentAvailable()` requires all three or SMS stays hidden | No for merge; **yes for live SMS smoke** |

**Not a blocker for merging this branch** — the feature is designed to be safely mergeable with SMS disabled (email OTP + TOTP keep working exactly as today). Do this whenever convenient; SMS just won't be selectable in the UI until then.

## Platform SMTP (Resend) — auth/system mail (Andrew-only)

Confirm-link, reset, 2FA email OTP, parent/claim mail all use `sendPlatformMail` (env SMTP only; fail-closed; never tutor Gmail). Live mail needs:

| # | Action | Why | Blocks code? |
|---|--------|-----|--------------|
| 1 | Resend account + verify `usemynk.com` DNS (SPF/DKIM) | Domain must be allowed to send | No for merge |
| 2 | Vercel env: `SMTP_HOST=smtp.resend.com`, `SMTP_PORT=465`, `SMTP_SECURE=true`, `SMTP_USER=resend`, `SMTP_PASS=<key>`, `SMTP_FROM=noreply@usemynk.com` | Without these, live confirm/reset/2FA-email/claim fail-closed with an honest error | No for merge; **yes for live auth-mail smoke** |

See [`docs/DEPLOY.md`](../DEPLOY.md). Tests inject the sender; do not wait on DNS to merge.

## Background eyeballs (not merge-blocking)

| Item | Doc | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| Dedupe Wave A/B + tokens visual pass | [`DEDUPE-EYEBALL-LIST.md`](DEDUPE-EYEBALL-LIST.md) | Partial 2026-07-27; finish when convenient |
| Design-system gallery | BACKLOG § QUEUED | Not built yet — queued |
| Neon scale-to-zero revisit | BACKLOG **NEON-SCALE-TO-ZERO-REVISIT** (§10) | Enabled 5-min suspend 2026-08-28 to stop idle CU-hours. Re-check once real lessons are regular (first-hit cold start / Prisma timeout). Do not flip always-on just because compute is Active during a session. |

## What agents are doing without you

| Priority | Work | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| **#1** | `/login` Sign in with Google + Playwright | **DONE** — merged [`122bf761`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/122bf761) |
| #1 next | Calendar OAuth **connect + stub** | **DONE** — merged [`da93ab78`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/da93ab78). Add callback URI + enable Calendar API; **submit one bundled verification** when this is on prod/preview |
| #2 | Student-detail Start / consent / claim findability | **DONE** — merged [`f08d56b5`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/f08d56b5) |
| #3 | Tutor signup / self-serve auth | **DONE** first chunk + REJECTED/revoke [`99da0111`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/99da0111). Leftover: pagination, invite links. |
| #4 | Email OTP 2FA + SMS + allowlist | **CODE DONE** on `feat/auth-ship-ready` (not merged at last refresh). Email confirm, platform mail, 2FA chooser, SMS fail-closed, tutor email allowlist. Your leftover: SMTP + Twilio env + add Sarah/Tyson in operator UI. |
| #5 | Native schedule CRUD | **DONE** — merged [`1bbd9216`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/1bbd9216). Google outbound write waits on your Console verification. |
| #6 | Security MUST for strangers | Composer-sized holes **DONE** (origin pin, VERIFY-ACCT-1, test-route hard-404, SMOKE-PRIV-1). Leftovers: npm audit (blast radius), join-404 UX (intentional), Resend/legal-blocked. |
| #7 | First-party instrumentation | **DONE** chunk 1 — merged [`3e9cccf4`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/3e9cccf4) (`ProductEvent` tutor funnel). Chunk 2 later (no PostHog). |
| #3 leftover | Waitlist REJECTED + revoke | **DONE** [`99da0111`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/99da0111). Pagination deferred. Invite links need your call (operator-invite vs open signup). |
| #6 leftover | Join denial UX | **DONE** [`647aaf24`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/647aaf24). Wrong AH on `/join` → `/account/not-my-session`. |

**You do not need to smoke** Sign-In UI until feature DONE (Playwright green + verify + merge). Then one hardware pass: real Google account that already exists as `AdminUser` → `/login` → Google → land past 2FA setup as today.

**Live Sign-In smoke (after merge) also needs:**
- Redirect URI: `https://<host>/api/auth/callback/google` (prod `usemynk.com`) and `http://localhost:3100/api/auth/callback/google` (or your local port)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` + `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` set on the Vercel env for that deployment
- Same Mortensen Apps umbrella OAuth client as Gmail; scopes `openid email profile` only
- Google does **not** auto-provision — email must already be an `AdminUser`

**Known leftover (not this PR):** visual `login.png` baseline + pre-existing login `page-has-heading-one` a11y (`AuthShell` title is a `<div>`). Follow-up, not a Sign-In blocker.

## One-liner “where are we?”

> Release track option B. Tutor-auth ship-ready **code-complete** on `feat/auth-ship-ready` (WS0–WS4 verified). Andrew 2026-09-15: do not block merge on the pre-existing `test:wb-sync` cluster (see [`ORCHESTRATOR-STATE.md`](ORCHESTRATOR-STATE.md) HEAD). Your open work = platform SMTP + Twilio env + Sarah/Tyson allowlist + calendar verification + Privacy/Terms eyeball.
