# ORCHESTRATOR STATE — canonical living bootstrap

> **READ THIS FIRST.** This file is the **single source of current orchestrator state** for tutoring-notes. We keep it current continuously (lightweight head every material turn; full restructure at milestones). A **brand-new orchestrator chat** must read it before dispatching work and must **NOT** ask Andrew for catch-up on what's done, where we are, what's next, or how we work — this doc, its reading list, and `git log` are authoritative.

> **Operating contract (`.cursor/rules/orchestrator-discipline.mdc`, explicit @ [`7341ff9`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/7341ff9)):** State durability is a **primary reliability obligation**, not a nicety. Andrew offloads project memory to the orchestrator on purpose — at any moment a session can be lost and a fresh orchestrator must resume with **minimal re-guidance** (ideally just "continue"). Keep this file continuously current; treat "I'll update state later" as a silent failure.

## ⏩ HEAD — 2026-06-30 consent-batch + Part 3 design-pass gate on `wb-wave5-polish`

> **Active branch:** [`wb-wave5-polish`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/tree/wb-wave5-polish) — code @ [`8c9f68b`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/8c9f68b). **Worktree:** `tutoring-notes-polishwt` (default `tutoring-notes` checkout is on `v1-redesign` — NOT current). **All remaining Sarah-gate work lands here; single `merge --no-ff` to `v1-redesign` at final gate only (no interim merge, Andrew confirmed).** Integration base remains **`v1-redesign` @ [`7397abc`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/7397abc)**.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Last action completed** | **Consent/permission hardening DONE:** tutor consent modal removed; `CONSENT_ENFORCEMENT` deleted; `sessionPhase=ACTIVE` server guards; `allowLiveSession=false` blocks learner join; `allowNoteSending` ungated + UI hidden (`WB-NOTES-EMAIL-SUBSCRIPTION-REFRAME`). **Plan input decisions resolved 2026-06-30:** per-speaker ≤3–4 cap no mixdown fallback; **t=0 = FSM recording entry (RATIFIED INPUT)** + WB↔audio hardware sync oracle; eval harness post-Sarah; session-scoped consent override → BACKLOG won't-build. **Andrew ratified Part 3 design-pass gate:** no p3-* execution until design session with Andrew approves overall Part 3 architecture/sequencing. |
| **Next action(s)** | **(1) Part 1 residuals** on `wb-wave5-polish`: `useLiveAvCoordinator` + `useRecordingCoordinator` extraction, unified `WbTopBar`, CSS monolith split (touched surfaces), `p1a-reconnect-finish` (VERIFY-FIRST — likely done), `p1d-legacy-tests` (VERIFY-FIRST — likely script cleanup). **(2) Part 2 residuals:** in-person consent projection (`p2a-inperson-consent`), `allowWhiteboardRecording` verify (`p2a-wb-recording-verify`). **(3) Part 1+2 checkpoint (NO merge):** `test:wb-sync` + surrogates + `npx next build` + hardware A/V smoke. **(4) Part 3 DESIGN PASS with Andrew (MANDATORY GATE — no p3-* before this).** **(5) Part 3 spine (only after design pass):** `p3-clock` FIRST (t=0 ratified input) → `p3-perspeaker-capture` → … → `p3-replay-scrub` → `p3-video-seam` (design-only). **(6) FINAL Sarah gate:** full-experience hardware smoke both themes → single `merge --no-ff` to `v1-redesign`. |
| **Open Andrew-confirms** | **Part 3 design pass (LIVE GATE):** overall Part 3 architecture/sequencing must be reviewed and approved by Andrew in a design session before any p3-* execution. Ratified inputs (t=0, peer cap, eval timing, tap-before-mix) are NOT a substitute for this gate. **Standing:** **WB-LABEL-PARENT-SIGNIN** new term; **Sarah primary device** (assumed Windows desktop Chromium — verify on next call, [`SARAH-CALL-PREP.md`](../SARAH-CALL-PREP.md)); **Ship-to-Sarah gate** (notes path, end/continue save discipline, single-segment seek); **iOS student WB/A/V** zero real-device coverage ([`BACKLOG.md`](../BACKLOG.md) **WB-STUDENT-MOBILE-VALIDATION**). |
| **In-flight subagents** | **None.** |
| **Uncommitted / unmerged** | **`wb-wave5-polish` @ `8c9f68b`** — pushed; **not merged** to `v1-redesign`. **`v1-redesign` @ `7397abc`** unchanged. |

**Strategic posture (unchanged):** Experience-driven wedge — WB + reliability = **ground floor (GATE)**; the win = accreting honest tutor-first continuity. [`experience-driven_wedge_ae2776e1.plan.md`](../../../../.cursor/plans/experience-driven_wedge_ae2776e1.plan.md). **Ship-to-Sarah gate** still governs cut to `v1-redesign → master` — see condensed block below.

**Process directives (standing):** preview links in **pairs** (Vercel MCP `branchAlias` + `https://preview.usemynk.com` when repointed); agent-runnable validation harnesses over manual smoke where possible; Opus-default for this reliability effort, Composer 2.5 only for zero-doubt mechanical tasks per active plan.

## Project arc + North Star

Pre-public pilot with one tutor (Sarah). North Star from [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md): *"People need to use the app with confidence. Sarah is being patient, but that won't last forever."* Reliability bar: [`../../agenticPipeline/.cursor/rules/reliability-bar.mdc`](../../agenticPipeline/.cursor/rules/reliability-bar.mdc).

**Current program:** Complete the **live-session arc** (auth join → waiting room → live A/V whiteboard → end → per-speaker capture → transcription → review) as one reliable unit on `wb-wave5-polish`, then **single merge** to `v1-redesign` (the Sarah merge).

## Branch layering

```
master  ←  v1-redesign  (integration base @ 7397abc; Wave 4 merged; held for Sarah gate + master cut)
              ↑
              └── wb-wave5-polish @ 8c9f68b  (ALL remaining work; worktree tutoring-notes-polishwt; NO interim merge)
```

| Branch | Role | Tip |
|---|---|---|
| **`v1-redesign`** | Integration base; Wave 4 student responsive parity merged @ [`a166f6c`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/a166f6c); subsequent doc commits through [`7397abc`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/7397abc) | Not yet merged to `master` — held for Gate A + Ship-to-Sarah + comprehensive re-smoke |
| **`wb-wave5-polish`** | **Active execution branch** — Wave 5 chrome/polish + reliability floor (Parts 1–3 of active plan); worktree `tutoring-notes-polishwt` | [`8c9f68b`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/8c9f68b) |

**Merge discipline (ratified):** All remaining work stays on `wb-wave5-polish`. **Single `merge --no-ff` to `v1-redesign`** at the final Sarah gate only. No interim merge.

Decisions ledger: [`docs/handoff/v1-redesign-STATUS.md`](v1-redesign-STATUS.md).

## Current Wave focus

**Active plan:** [`whiteboard_reliability_remaining_b082882.plan.md`](../../../../.cursor/plans/whiteboard_reliability_remaining_b082882.plan.md) — supersedes archived [`whiteboard_reliability_floor_9ba650d1.SUPERSEDED.plan.md`](../../../../.cursor/plans/archive/whiteboard_reliability_floor_9ba650d1.SUPERSEDED.plan.md).

**Done on branch (Parts 0, 1A mostly, 2A, 2B mostly):** guardrails, A/V bug fixes (enumerate-mutex, audio-reneg), waiting-room overlay, auth-join, lifecycle/consent unconditional enforcement, phantom-stroke fix, per-speaker investigation.

**Remaining (execution order):**

## Queued dispatches (in order)

1. **Part 1 residuals** — coordinator extractions, unified `WbTopBar`, CSS co-location, `p1a-reconnect-finish` (VERIFY-FIRST), `p1d-legacy-tests` (VERIFY-FIRST).
2. **Part 2 residuals** — in-person consent projection, `allowWhiteboardRecording` e2e verify.
3. **`p1-checkpoint`** — full `test:wb-sync` + regression + build + hardware A/V (NO merge).
4. **Part 3 DESIGN PASS with Andrew** — mandatory gate; no p3-* execution before Andrew approves overall Part 3 architecture/sequencing.
5. **Part 3 spine** — per-speaker capture through replay-scrub (only after design pass); video seam design-only.
6. **`p-final-gate`** — both themes hardware smoke → **`merge --no-ff` `wb-wave5-polish` → `v1-redesign`**.
7. **`p-test-account-reset`** — at master cut, preserve Andrew + Sarah admin accounts.

## Ship-to-Sarah gate (CONFIRMED by Andrew 2026-06-16 — still governing)

Andrew wants Sarah on the `v1-redesign` line once **waiting room → WB → end session is stable for tutor AND student — backend data pipeline INCLUDED**. Capture: [`sarah-pilot-feedback-2026-06-16-orchestrator-report.md`](sarah-pilot-feedback-2026-06-16-orchestrator-report.md).

**Confirmed gate items:** (1) notes — legacy monolithic generate path gone; per-chunk auto-notes only; (2) End/Continue on student-detail open-sessions never silently deletes recording; (3) single-segment seek works at every review entry point. Multi-segment seek → backlog SSG-3 only.

**Pre-master smoke deferral ledger:** [`pre-master-smoke-deferral-ledger-2026-06-16.md`](pre-master-smoke-deferral-ledger-2026-06-16.md).

## Open decisions — Andrew confirms

### Live gate (Part 3)

| # | Question | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Part 3 design pass** | Overall Part 3 architecture/sequencing — review and approve in design session with Andrew before any p3-* execution | **OPEN — mandatory gate** |

Ratified **inputs** (not substitutes for the design pass): t=0 = FSM `recording` entry / `MediaRecorder.start()` + WB↔audio hardware sync oracle; 3+-peer per-speaker ≤3–4 cap NO mixdown fallback; minimal eval harness post-Sarah only; session-scoped consent override won't build for Sarah (`WB-SESSION-CONSENT-OVERRIDE`).

### Standing (from prior threads)

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| **WB-ADULT-JOIN-ENABLEMENT B1** | Thread B product confirm |
| **WB-LABEL-PARENT-SIGNIN** | New term confirm |
| **Sarah primary device** | Assumed Windows desktop Chromium |
| **iOS student WB/A/V** | Zero coverage — [`BACKLOG.md`](../BACKLOG.md) **WB-STUDENT-MOBILE-VALIDATION** |
| **B2 consent Step 6** | Parent per-tutor consent management UI — deferred past V1 |

---

## Recent architectural decisions (2026-06-30)

| Decision | Status |
|---|---|
| **Consent enforcement unconditional** | ✅ `CONSENT_ENFORCEMENT` deleted; always-on |
| **Per-speaker tap-before-mix** | ✅ Design-around ratified — transcription lanes only; mixdown = sole replay source; merge by `recordingTimeOffsetMs` never `createdAt` |
| **Reverses prior rollback [`89e0fe1`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/89e0fe1)** | ✅ With sync-metadata contract — document in LIVE-AV.md invariant #6 during `p3-perspeaker-capture` |
| **No interim merge** | ✅ All work on `wb-wave5-polish`; single merge at Sarah gate |
| **t=0 clock anchor** | ✅ **RATIFIED INPUT (2026-06-30)** — FSM `recording` / `MediaRecorder.start()`; WB↔audio hardware sync oracle in `p3-clock`. Part 3 **execution** still gated on design pass. |
| **WB-MENU-CLICK-THROUGH** | Deferred post-Sarah → [`BACKLOG.md`](../BACKLOG.md) |
| **Test data reset at master cut** | Preserve Andrew + Sarah admin; reset disposable learners (`p-test-account-reset`) |

Full locked decisions: active plan § "Resolved (Andrew)".

## Hard-won lessons (durable)

### New (2026-06-30)

**lesson-codified-hack — tutor/student waiting-room mic delta mis-scoped twice:** First codified a chip-hack; then flattened tutor's full `MicControls` dropdown to match student's stripped control. **Tell:** student/tutor asymmetry. Echoes "branch decisions ≠ ratified intent" + "confirm material UX deltas explicitly."

**lesson-deferred-relay — relay specs authored with suite run DEFERRED had harness bugs jest couldn't catch:** Both phantom-stroke spec (wrong URL/auth + naive absence oracle) and consent-denial spec (`consentRecord.create()` unique-constraint) failed only at integration relay. **NEW RULE:** new wb-regression specs should get **≥1 targeted relay run** before declaring done, even when full suite run is deferred.

**data-reset-at-master-cut:** At `v1-redesign → master` cut, reset test data but **preserve Andrew + Sarah admin accounts**; re-confirm with Sarah then. Concrete todo: `p-test-account-reset`.

**no-interim-merge:** Ratified — single `merge --no-ff` at final Sarah gate only.

### Still load-bearing (do not forget)

**Plans ≠ ratified intent (2026-06-17):** Material product/UX decisions must be surfaced to Andrew explicitly — silence is not consent.

**Missed prompt ≠ consent (2026-06-17):** Re-surface material decisions; never infer from inaction.

**Subagent git safety (2026-06-10):** Never `git restore`/`reset --hard` to unblock checkout when uncommitted user work exists.

**Whiteboard chrome — extend don't rewrite (2026-06-09):** ADDITIVE ONLY on `WhiteboardWorkspaceClient.tsx` engine paths.

**Layout/coordinates — jsdom blind spot (2026-05-30):** Prove geometry on real browser; requirement-not-code tests.

**Flag-gated feature + test-injected flag = synthetic green (2026-06-17):** Green on flagged test path ≠ production default wired.

**Tombstone resurrection (2026-06-18):** Reconcile baseline must use `getSceneElementsIncludingDeleted()`.

**MediaStream id blocks video remount (2026-06-18):** Fresh `MediaStream` on reconnect.

**Mobile backgrounding ≠ full mesh rebuild (2026-06-18):** Deliberate leave vs transient suspend.

**Doc-heavy merges → add/add conflicts (2026-06-18):** Union-merge; preserve Andrew's smoke notes.

**RSC cookie-write no-op (2026-06-14):** Never write cookies from RSC render.

**CSS `@layer` cascade (2026-06-12):** Legacy unlayered base CSS beats Tailwind utilities.

**Secret egress (2026-05-31):** No plaintext secrets to third-party URLs (2FA QR lesson).

## Pilot context (Sarah)

Latest capture: [`sarah-pilot-feedback-2026-06-16-orchestrator-report.md`](sarah-pilot-feedback-2026-06-16-orchestrator-report.md). Call prep: [`SARAH-CALL-PREP.md`](../SARAH-CALL-PREP.md).

Sarah remains on production `master` ("old & busted") until Ship-to-Sarah gate passes on merged `v1-redesign` line.

---

## Parked threads (after Sarah merge)

| Thread | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Experience-driven wedge Phases 2–4** | Continuity engine, note quality, instrumentation — post this merge |
| **WB-COMPONENTS-PASS** | Full shadcn migration — incremental on touched surfaces only for now |
| **VIDEO recording capture** | Design seam in Part 3; build post-Sarah |
| **WB-MENU-CLICK-THROUGH** | Desktop popover click-through |
| **iOS per-speaker MediaRecorder** | Documented untested for Sarah merge |
| **`docs/phase3-consent-model` @ `4f9dbcd`** | Awaits union-merge to `v1-redesign` (conflict risk on handoff docs) |
| **A6-1 multi-segment replay** | Obviated by continuous-stream finalization in Part 3; legacy path neutralized not deleted |

---

## Housekeeping (pending — do not act until merge confirmed)

Worktree cleanup after integration merged: `tutoring-notes-polishwt`, `fixwt`, `liveboardwt` (+ consent/phantom satellite worktrees). See `git worktree list`.

## How we work (process — pointers only)

- **Orchestration model:** [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) § "Model usage protocol"
- **Dispatch boundary:** [`.cursor/rules/orchestrator-discipline.mdc`](../../.cursor/rules/orchestrator-discipline.mdc)
- **Merging (solo pilot):** smokeable branch → Andrew smoke → `merge --no-ff`; WB sync → `npm run test:wb-sync` at merge boundary; build-surface → `npx next build`
- **Smokebooks:** [`SMOKEBOOK-TEMPLATE.md`](SMOKEBOOK-TEMPLATE.md); preview URL via Vercel MCP (never guessed)
- **Commits on Windows/PowerShell:** `.git/COMMIT_MSG_DRAFT.txt` + `git commit -F`

## Open questions still in flight

| Question | Status |
|---|---|
| **Part 3 design pass** | **OPEN — mandatory gate before p3-* execution** |
| Map/reduce notes accuracy | Poor today — model abstraction + post-Sarah eval |
| Two-way calendar sync | Unresolved — [`scheduling-requirements-2026-06-11.md`](scheduling-requirements-2026-06-11.md) |

Resolved 2026-06-30 (ratified inputs, not design-pass substitute): t=0 anchor; 3+-peer cap ≤3–4 no mixdown fallback; session-scoped consent override won't build; minimal eval post-Sarah only.
