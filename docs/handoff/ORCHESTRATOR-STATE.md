## HEAD

**✅ RELAY GATE NOW TRUSTWORTHY — all 3 runner defects fixed; trustworthy classification of the 6 reds done (2026-07-07 ~18:37).** Runner defects all resolved: (1) `--project` arg [`38ce3c3`], (2) blob-merge only-last-shard [`fb3c039`], (3) isolation `-g` grep-arg crash [`956e235`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/956e235) — isolation now selects by **`file:line`** (no regex/shell-split fragility). **Direct fresh-server isolation of the 6 genuine failures ([Composer](4ca66c31-d75f-4f42-9519-a1a1a529b812), ~9min):**
- **1 ENV-FLAKE:** `wb-replay-active-board-tab:95` (passes isolated — only fails under marathon exhaustion).
- **5 REAL (deterministic, fail initial+retry):** (#1) `wb-chrome-interactions.spec.ts:528/550` — "Sharp" roughness chip button NOT FOUND in `wb-props-panel` (`toHaveClass` unreachable); (#3) **`wb-tutor-recording-mute.spec.ts:70/106` = Bug A** — recording-branch gain **1 ≠ 0** on mute-before-graph (KNOWN real product gap, sanity-check ✓); (#4) `wb-notes-shimmer.spec.ts:223/229` — `tutor-notes-status` not found / copy mismatch (**got "Preparing your notes..." vs expected "Waiting for transcript…"** — smells STALE ORACLE); (#5) `wb-student-mic-persistence.spec.ts:213` — `audio-device-select` not found in `wb-topbar-mic` (30s timeout); (#6) `smoke/whiteboard-workspace.spec.ts:131` — after Start, URL stuck on student page not `/workspace` (needs BLOB — possible harness).

**⚠️ "REAL" = deterministic, spans PRODUCT-REGRESSION vs STALE-ORACLE vs HARNESS-SETUP** — NOT auto product bugs. Failure signatures suggest several are stale oracles from wave-5 UI/notes/chrome work (#1 chip, #4 copy, #5 device-select) + Bug A real + #6 possibly harness. **NEXT:** (a) **TRIAGE the 5 REAL** (explore: per-spec regression-vs-stale-oracle-vs-harness, cite product code + git blame master..HEAD, recommend product-fix vs test-realign); (b) fix accordingly (Bug A = fragile plan-mode→Sonnet path). Shard-6 (audio-upload+apply-remote) stays green. Merge-gate #1 = green once the 5 REAL are resolved (fix or justified test-realign).

---

**🟨 RE-RUN with blob fix (2026-07-07 ~18:23, tip `6c96016`, `terminals/472990.txt`) — SUPERSEDED by the trustworthy classification above (isolation grep-arg since fixed `956e235`).** Was: blob-merge FIX CONFIRMED, but a 3rd runner defect (isolation grep-arg) corrupts classification. ✅ **Blob fix works:** merge now extracts ALL 6 shard blobs (`lifecycle`+`shard-2..6`); aggregate found **6 unexpected failures** across all shards (cross-shard blindness gone). ❌ **"REAL-FAIL: 6" is UNTRUSTWORTHY** — the isolation pass builds `-g <raw test title>` without regex-escaping or a `--` options-terminator, so titles with `--word`, em-dash `—`, or `(...)` crash the isolation subprocess on ARG PARSING (not a real test failure) → false REAL-FAIL. Confirmed ≥4 of 6 never ran a test: `wb-chrome-interactions:528` (`unknown option '--active'`), `wb-replay-active-board-tab:95` (`Invalid regex /(2/`), `wb-student-mic-persistence:150` (`non-ascii dash —`), `whiteboard-workspace:107` (`Invalid regex /(needs/`). Only `wb-tutor-recording-mute:70` (Bug A) + `wb-notes-shimmer:209` MIGHT have run. **The 6 genuine first-attempt failures (from the trustworthy merged JSON) are:** wb-chrome-interactions:528, wb-replay-active-board-tab:95, wb-tutor-recording-mute:70 (Bug A, known-real), wb-notes-shimmer:209, wb-student-mic-persistence:150, smoke/whiteboard-workspace:107. **REAL vs ENV-FLAKE still UNKNOWN** (strong prior: most are ENV-FLAKE marathon-exhaustion per the full-suite baseline + 22-red triage; Bug A is the one confirmed-real). **NEXT:** (a) FIX isolation grep-arg bug (Composer, test-infra — regex-escape title + `--` terminator, or select by file+escaped `--grep`); (b) directly isolate-classify the 6 known specs (fresh server each, correct invocation) — faster than another full gate; (c) fix the confirmed-real ones (Bug A fragile path). Shard-6 (audio-upload+apply-remote fixes) = 22 passed, exit 0 — stays green.

**🚨 CRITICAL CORRECTION (2026-07-07, confirming relay run tip `995466e`, `terminals/363549.txt`): the sharded runner's GATE VERDICT ONLY EVER REFLECTED SHARD 6 — every "validated" claim below for shards 1–5 is HOLLOW.** Root cause: each shard's Playwright run cleans `test-results/` (the outputDir), which wipes the prior shard's blob zip; `MERGE_BLOB_DIR = test-results/wb-shard-blobs` lives *inside* that cleaned dir, so at merge time ONLY `shard-6-report.zip` survives. **Proof:** merged JSON (`test-results/wb-shard-merged.json`) `stats = {expected:22, unexpected:0, flaky:0, skipped:0}`, 8 suites = shard-6 exactly. So `merge-reports` + the isolation/REAL-FAIL classifier have NEVER seen shards 1–5. The "F2 DONE/validated", "CLEAN GATE VERDICT / 163 across 6 shards", and "REAL-FAIL: 3" claims only ever classified shard 6 (whose 3 reds — audio-upload:86/:101, apply-remote:83 — coincidentally were all in shard 6, so they surfaced; everything else was invisible).

**TRUE per-shard results this run (read from raw Playwright stdout summaries, ANSI-stripped):**
- **lifecycle (shard 1): 48 passed, exit 0 ✓**
- **shard-2: 2 failed** — `wb-chrome-interactions.spec.ts:528` (selected-chip `toHaveClass` on hover) + **`wb-e2-pdf-stroke-leak.spec.ts:74`** (canonical PDF-leak spec — "board-3 strokes stay on board-3", `toBe` — the spec we believed passes 3/3!)
- **shard-3: 1 failed** — `wb-replay-active-board-tab.spec.ts:95` (scrub updates active replay board tab, `toHaveAttribute`)
- **shard-4: 1 failed** — **`wb-tutor-recording-mute.spec.ts:70` = BUG A (WS-I-PRESTART-MUTE), gain 0 at init**
- **shard-5: 3 failed** — `wb-notes-shimmer.spec.ts:209` (overlay `toHaveText`) + `wb-student-mic-persistence.spec.ts:150` (persisted mic pre-selected `toBeVisible`) + `smoke/whiteboard-workspace.spec.ts:107` (`createWhiteboardSession` `toHaveURL`, needs BLOB)
- **shard-6: 22 passed, exit 0 ✓** — **audio-upload:86/:101 (`a12d1da`) + apply-remote:83 (`abfbe9a`) fixes CONFIRMED GREEN**

**⇒ 9 UNCLASSIFIED reds across shards 2–5** (isolation never ran on them). Several likely ENV-FLAKE (blob/transcribe/dev-server-exhaustion noise — notes-shimmer "real pipeline", whiteboard-workspace "needs BLOB", possibly mic-persistence/replay/chrome timing), but **Bug A (`wb-tutor-recording-mute:70`) is a KNOWN-REAL branch-only product defect** (see A4 root-cause `81813fa3`) and the **canonical `wb-e2-pdf-stroke-leak:74` failing is notable** (needs isolated confirm — may be exhaustion). **Bug A was NEVER "non-repro": it lives in shard 4, which the runner never captured.**

**NEXT (revised):** (a) **✅ DONE — runner blob-preservation FIXED ([Composer](58e6f546-7bf1-43ff-83de-a224293e08b0), [`fb3c039`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/fb3c039)):** TWO wipe mechanisms found — (1) Playwright `createRemoveOutputDirsTask` cleans `test-results/` at each run start → moved `MERGE_BLOB_DIR` to repo-root `wb-shard-blobs/` (sibling, not under test-results); (2) BlobReporter `_prepareOutputFile()` self-cleans its own output dir each run → set `PWTEST_BLOB_DO_NOT_REMOVE=1` on shard env. + one-time clear at run start + `.gitignore`. Minimal 2-shard proof: merged JSON covered BOTH spec files (not just last); `node --check` clean; manifest 163/163. (b) **⏳ AWAIT ANDREW GO — attended re-run** (`test:wb-sync`, ~35-50min) → real REAL-FAIL/ENV-FLAKE classification for the 9 shard-2–5 reds. (c) **Triage the REAL ones** (Bug A already confirmed-real → fragile plan-mode→Sonnet path below; canonical pdf-leak:74 + the others need the isolation classification). NOTE: audio-upload:86/:101 + apply-remote:83 (F3) fixes are independently CONFIRMED green in shard 6 — those stay done.

---

**⚠️ SUPERSEDED by the correction above — retained for audit trail:** ~~F2 relay-shards DONE + VALIDATED; merge-gate verdict trustworthy~~ (verdict only covered shard 6):
- **Run #1** aborted instantly — F2a runner gave Playwright spec paths where it expected `--project=wb-regression` (Windows `spawnSync shell:true` arg-concat) → **FIXED [`38ce3c3`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/38ce3c3)** (combined `--project=wb-regression` + positional filters).
- **Run #2** — shards 1–5 clean (135 pass/0 fail on fresh per-shard :3100 servers; WS-T #7 lifecycle confirmed green), but surfaced two runner defects: shard-6 collapsed (0 pass — the 6th shard re-ran `integration-setup` which timed out under cumulative load → dependency-skipped all 22) and the isolation pass OVER-COLLECTED ("99" — `parseFailures` matched every `[wb-regression]` stdout progress line, not just reds). Runaway stopped safely (:3002 untouched).
- **Round-2 runner fixes [`e535cca`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/e535cca):** isolation now reads merged **blob JSON**, collecting only `projectName=wb-regression && status=unexpected` (no passed/skipped/flaky); shards + isolation run `--no-deps` (setup runs once upfront, not per shard); + 8s inter-shard cooldown + orphaned :3100/:3101 node cleanup.
- **Run #3 (post-fix) — CLEAN GATE VERDICT:** jest pre-gate **856/856**; all 163 ran across **6 fully-completing shards** (lifecycle 47+1flaky, shard-2 21, shard-3 21, shard-4 22, shard-5 18, shard-6 19 — shard-6 no longer collapses); isolation correctly narrowed to **3 genuine `unexpected` failures (not 99)** → classified **REAL-FAIL: 3, ENV-FLAKE: 0**. Full log: `terminals/889258.txt`.

**🔴 The 3 REAL-FAILs are GENUINE deterministic failures (NOT exhaustion) — confirmed by a fresh/idle-machine isolated re-run (`terminals/193129.txt`, 3 failed / 1 passed):**
1. **`audio-upload.spec.ts:86`** — "Upload tab visible + dropzone": the `audio-upload-dropzone` element is PRESENT in the DOM but `hidden` after clicking the Upload tab (8× resolved hidden, 5s timeout). Real, repeatable.
2. **`audio-upload.spec.ts:101`** — "transcribe + generate populates note form": the `ai-transcribe-btn` ("Transcribe & generate notes") is **`disabled`** so the click times out (120s). Real, repeatable. **⚠️ notes/transcribe surface — Ship-to-Sarah-gate-adjacent.**
3. **`wb-e2-apply-remote-pdf-stroke-leak.spec.ts:83`** — WS-X fingerprint-guard = **known test-only Bug B** (F3; stale/mistimed oracle — spec dies at preconditions, guard proven sound 3/3; see A4 WS-X row).

**Bug A `wb-tutor-recording-mute` did NOT appear in the failure set** (run #2 shard-4 23/23; run #3 shard-4 22 pass) — consistent non-repro; mute-before-graph-ready race is timing/environment-sensitive; **re-confirm reproduction before touching that fragile surface.**

**✅ TRIAGE DONE ([explore](ec500d9d-e4de-475f-b34b-9da8ec6ec28c)) — all 3 relay reds are TEST-ONLY; ZERO tutor-facing product regressions on `wb-wave5-polish`** (mirrors the earlier full-suite finding: product clean, harness needed hardening). (1) **`audio-upload:86`** = stale oracle — B3 always-mount upload pane is `display:none` until `activeTab==="upload"` (default `"record"`); test clicks tab but doesn't wait for pane visible. Behavior pre-exists on `master`; only *exposed* by harness-gate `eb3fb5d`. Fix = test realignment (wait for `audio-tab-upload-pane` visible / `aria-selected`; scroll Notes section into view). (2) **`audio-upload:101`** = stale oracle / already-tracked **RW-7** (`wb-wave5-execution-queue.md` item (b)) — test's upload stub returns legacy Vercel JSON, but harness uses mint+PUT blob flow (`a1cc2bd`/`2278013`) → upload never completes → `pendingAudios` empty → transcribe btn correctly disabled; weak `.or(ai-transcribe-btn)` assertion. Fix = harness-aware stub + assert `toBeEnabled()`. **GUARDRAIL: do NOT enable the transcribe btn without an upload — that breaks real gating.** (3) **`apply-remote:83`** = known **test-only Bug B / F3** (WS-X) — keep its own careful/attended pass (A4 WS-X row: settle L146 onChange-leak question first, then realign).

**✅ audio-upload realignment DONE (test-only, [`a12d1da`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/a12d1da), Composer):** :86 → scroll `#student-section-notes` + `switchToUploadTab()` waits for `audio-tab-upload-pane` visible before dropzone assert; :101 (RW-7) → harness-aware upload stub (`route.continue()` mint+PUT) + assert `pending-segment-list` visible + `ai-transcribe-btn` `toBeEnabled()`. Green: 3 passed, 1 retry-recovered flake on :101 (`switchToUploadTab` first-try scroll-spy timing — watch in relay). Product unchanged. Dedup debt logged (BACKLOG: `installControllableUploadStub` now 3× inline → extract).

**F3 STEP-BACK DONE ([explore](50bc5027-340d-4f04-81c9-eede3f5e41a5)) — verdict: NO product bug; both reds test-only, BUT realignment touches a WS-X product seam.** L159 (`fingerprintActive===true`) = deterministic **stale oracle** (fingerprint cleared by design on first legit post-switch onChange, WWC L4672-4675; spec checks seconds too late). L146 (`every type==="image"`) = **duplicate** of canonical `wb-e2-pdf-stroke-leak.spec.ts` (passes 3/3) — not a real leak. `ef5fb1a` applyRemote guard is sound-by-review, all in `WhiteboardWorkspaceClient.tsx` (NO `src/lib/whiteboard/` change). **CATCH:** the spec's real oracle (`__WBX_INJECT_APPLY_REMOTE__` L205-219) has NEVER executed (spec dies at L159 precondition); current injection fires *after* fingerprint clears → doesn't exercise the guard. Correct realignment = retime injection to fire *inside* the fingerprint window → needs a NEW E2E-gated test seam inside WWC `selectTutorPage`/`releaseGuard` (restore the parked `5d80ea8` pre-arm pattern). That's a product-file seam on the most-fragile surface → per WS-X doctrine NOT a blind Composer edit. **AWAIT ANDREW: pick approach — (A rec) Sonnet-authored seam + realignment, attended, red-before/green-after proof (revert WWC L1046 guard → oracle must fail) — properly discharges A4; (B) minimal test-only drop L146+L159 (risk: injection oracle fires post-clear → misleading pass or confusing red, leaves guard unproven); (C) quarantine spec for go-to-Sarah cut as tracked post-Sarah follow-up (guard sound-by-review + canonical covers steady-state) → unblocks merge gate now.**

**✅ F3 DONE — approach A ([Sonnet](73feb166-e9e4-4f35-8a3b-414776fbc734), [`abfbe9a`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/abfbe9a)):** additive E2E-gated `__WBX_ON_GUARD_RELEASE__` seam in WWC `releaseGuard` (27 ins / **0 del** — verified purely additive + prod-inert, guard clause L1053 confirmed present in commit); spec retimed to inject *inside* the fingerprint window; dropped L141-159 stale/duplicate asserts; oracle `toPass({10_000})`. **Red-before/green-after PROVEN** (guard intact → 2 passed; revert `!has(targetId)` → board-3 stroke leaks, fail both attempts) → `ef5fb1a` guard now test-proven, discharges A4 WS-X.

**✅ ALL 3 RELAY REDS RESOLVED — all test-only realignments, ZERO product regressions** (audio-upload:86 + :101 `a12d1da`; apply-remote:83 `abfbe9a`). Merge-gate #1 is ready for a confirming clean run.

**NEXT:** (a) **Confirming attended relay run** (`test:wb-sync`, full 6-shard, ~50min) — should now go fully green; watch the audio-upload :101 retry-covered flake. This is the orchestrator's attended job (needs Andrew's go — 50min + live-stack monitoring). (b) **Bug A** `wb-tutor-recording-mute` (WS-I-PRESTART-MUTE, BACKLOG reliability-gap — REAL branch-only product defect, must fix before WS-I→master) — NOTE non-repro in relay runs #2/#3; **re-confirm reproduction first**, then fragile: plan-mode → Sonnet 5-axis → fix; green spec = merge bar. (c) Then **Tranche E** (P2-WB-2 → P3).

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Last action completed** | **✅ Tranche F / F1 RESOLVED-via-defer (Andrew 2026-07-06, Option A).** Diagnosis-recommended global per-test `afterEach` `TRUNCATE ... CASCADE` on `tutoring_notes_test` **FAILED** (~40 failed suites/run × 3 consecutive `jest --workers=1` runs vs ~1-flake baseline) — `40P01` deadlocks + FK / "Engine is not yet connected" races. **Reframed root cause:** TRUNCATE's `AccessExclusiveLock` collides with **in-flight fire-and-forget async DB work that outlives test bodies** (same stragglers behind `Cannot log after tests are done` + `CostEvent_..._fkey` leaks). Failed attempt preserved in `git stash@{0}` on `wb-wave5-polish` (message: "F1 truncate attempt (FAILED...)"). **Salvaged + committed [`647ec35`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/647ec35):** `transcription-worker.test.ts` — `jest.mock("@/lib/recording/extract-chunk")` + `afterEach` microtask flush (stops map-phase async leak past teardown; green in isolation; tsc clean). **Dropped (reverted, stays in stash):** `upload-outbox.test.ts` observation-timing change (5000ms wait budget = Jest default timeout → timed out before diagnostic; T1+S1 markers never appeared). **Heavy jest-isolation DEFERRED** as tracked debt; merge-gate jest stays `--workers=1` + retry (~1-flake = loud stale-red, NOT false-green). **Standing gate convention (6)** added to execution-queue test doctrine (docs `971af78`). **✅ F2a BUILT + COMMITTED [`13c7522`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/13c7522):** serial sharded `wb-regression` relay runner (`scripts/wb-relay-shard-run.cjs` — fresh dev server per shard, manifest-from-config, union-asserted == `--list`, isolation re-run REAL-FAIL/ENV-FLAKE classifier) + safety port helper (`scripts/free-wb-dev-server-ports.cjs` — frozen allowlist [3100,3101], throws on any other incl. CLI, **never :3002**) + `test:wb-sync`→sharded (monolithic `test:wb-playwright` kept for bisect) + `playwright.config.ts` (`workers:1` on wb-regression, `:3101` webServer gated on `WB_SKIP_3101_WEBSERVER`). **163 enrollment verified static** (manifest union == `--list`); node --check + tsc clean. Orchestrator-reviewed: port allowlist safe, enrollment preserved. **NOT yet validated with a live relay run (F2b, attended).** Caveat to confirm in F2b: per-shard blob output env-var names (`PLAYWRIGHT_BLOB_OUTPUT_DIR/NAME`) — `merge-reports` may need adjustment; the gate VERDICT (shard exit + isolation re-run) does NOT depend on the merged HTML report. |
| **🟨 FULL-SUITE BASELINE result (2026-07-06, tip `c941247`, [run](8dbb2ff3-3ebd-47c8-831a-1af13d6e91d5))** | **NO product bugs / regressions / stale oracles found** beyond those already fixed (reassuring for product quality). **BUT the harness cannot currently run clean end-to-end** — a genuine confidence + merge-gate blocker, NOT product rot: (1) **jest `--workers=1` is NOT reliably green** — `claim-setup-consent-decline.test.ts` H-1 red on a **fixture email unique-constraint collision** (`createClaimedInviteFixture`), i.e. cross-test DB pollution even single-worker (wider than the previously-documented parallel-only "record not found" race); suite now 288/3083 (grew from the stale 283/3062 claim). (2) **`test:wb-sync` never reached the relay** — its wb-jest pre-gate flaked on the SAME fixture-email pattern (`register-audio-segment-action` `seedActiveSession` adminUser email). (3) **`auth.setup.ts` timed out** (signout/`/api/auth/csrf` `Unexpected end of JSON input`) → blocked ALL 163 wb-regression specs → **`wb-session-lifecycle` (our WS-T #7 fix) UNVERIFIED this run**; this is a RECURRENCE of the known harness-health flake (queue § (c)), now gating the entire relay. **Conclusion:** the test INFRA (fixture email uniqueness + no per-test cleanup + flaky auth.setup) — not product code — is what blocks "trust the suite wholesale" + merge-gate #1. Elevates **Tranche D jest-isolation + auth.setup hardening** to highest-leverage confidence work. |
| **🟥 HARNESS-HARDENING result (2026-07-06, [exec run](2f615c58-260f-4962-aca5-686cb2cacb12)) — partial + a NEW headline finding** | **Committed `3cb9a7b`** (shared globally-unique `uniq()` helper `src/__tests__/helpers/unique-test-token.ts` → 28 files; email-collision class GONE) + **`8a381ce`** (auth.setup erasure-admin leg now uses NextAuth **API-credentials** login, not flaky UI-signout — deviation from the diagnosed `clearCookies()` which itself hung on `/setup-required`; API-login matches parent/learner legs, verified 3×, auth.setup passes ~7.7s). Both pushed. **TWO open problems, NEITHER caused by these test-only changes:** (1) **jest `--workers=1` still can't hold 2 consecutive greens** — email red gone, but a SECOND isolation class remains (~1 flake/run, different DB-integration test each time: upload-outbox, share-audio-proxy, erasure-lifecycle, whiteboard-public-concat-audio, claim-setup — consistent with the diagnosis's un-done option (ii) "no per-test DB cleanup"). (2) **🚨 relay now RUNS and shows 22 HARD wb-regression failures + 14 flaky** (124 pass / 4 skip); `wb-session-lifecycle` itself = 48 pass/1 skip (4 flaky-passed-on-retry, WS-T #7 fix holds). These 22 were **MASKED** for an unknown period because auth.setup aborted all 163 specs — so the merge-gate relay has NOT been green. **Provably not from this session:** email fix is jest-only (can't touch Playwright specs); auth.setup passes (124 specs ran). ⇒ 22 reds are **pre-existing-masked and/or environmental** — under triage. |
| **22-red triage DONE ([classify run](88c2d0a2-eb37-46ec-a165-c6d20184b47e))** | **~65-75% ENVIRONMENTAL** (dev-server exhaustion over the 20-min serial marathon: log full of `ECONNRESET`, blob/transcribe 500s, ffmpeg-unavailable, `webpack.cache ENOENT`; 10/22 share the SAME `wb-session-review-mode`-never-renders-after-End symptom; smoke-workspace 2 = login `waitForURL` stalls). **NOT a branch-wide functional regression.** But **6 specs have concrete assertion failures** worth isolated confirmation, 2 on fragile surfaces: `wb-end-from-roster` (#9 `endedAt=null` after finalize — END-SESSION), `wb-tutor-recording-mute` (#19 gain 1≠0), `wb-review-overlay-3paths` roster-VAD (#17 "No audio" shown when VAD seeded), `wb-wave5-polish` item13 (#20 pill "Solo rehearsal" vs `/live/i` — LIKELY STALE ORACLE), `wb-e2-apply-remote-pdf-stroke-leak` (#7 fingerprint invariant false — WB SYNC), `audio-upload` dropzone (#1 hidden). |
| **🟥 6-spec isolated re-run DONE ([run](62b75c67-aa14-492f-a176-5b83c7d513f2)) — DEFINITIVE** | Fresh dev server per spec, `--workers=1`. **2 CONFIRMED REAL bugs** (deterministic, fail initial+retry — both FRAGILE surfaces, STOP before fixing): **(A) `wb-tutor-recording-mute` #19 — CONFIRMED REAL ([root-cause 81813fa3](81813fa3-b908-4363-8a48-600387a70c50)).** Mute BEFORE audio graph ready leaves recording-branch gain=**1** (expected 0) → tutor recorded at full gain when they expected muted. Root cause: WS-I mute contract lives at hook layer (`tutorRecordingMutedRef` + `useAudioRecorder.ts:1136`), but real UI path (`WbTopBarMicControl.tsx:63` awaits `onAcquireMic()` before `onToggleMute()`) delivers mute intent only via an async effect (`WhiteboardWorkspaceClient.tsx:2582`), while mount `acquireMic` finishes during the await and graph init hardcodes gain 1 (`mic-recorder-audio.ts:387`) with ref still false. **Branch-introduced (WS-I `f748ef7`, NOT on master — master has no recording mute gate at all ⇒ not Sarah-facing today), but means WS-I is INCOMPLETE for pre-start mute (a real completeness gap before WS-I merges).** Fix (fragile): synchronous `setTutorRecordingMute` on the mute click (not effect-only) and/or reorder toggle-before-acquire; optional `createMicAudioGraph` init param; add workspace-bridge DOM test. Composer step-back plan → Sonnet review if changing acquire ordering; do NOT merge without green `wb-tutor-recording-mute.spec.ts`. **(B) `wb-e2-apply-remote-pdf-stroke-leak` #7 — REFINED by root-cause ([83b45842](83b45842-d250-4c37-99fa-ffb4a661a3ad)): NOT a confirmed product bug.** The `fingerprintActive=false` (L159) failure is a **stale/mistimed TEST ORACLE** — the fingerprint is cleared by design once PDF import settles, so `false` is correct steady state; product guard (`ef5fb1a`) is logically sound but the spec never reaches its real `__WBX_INJECT_APPLY_REMOTE__` oracle (fix-a unproven, not disproven). **Branch-introduced (spec + fix both in `ef5fb1a`, NOT on master ⇒ not Sarah-facing).** L146 RESOLVED ([fda8a070](fda8a070-3faa-423b-a41e-43fa877d711f)): canonical guard spec `wb-e2-pdf-stroke-leak.spec.ts` passed **3/3 isolated** (fresh server each) → NO real onChange stroke leak; L146 was intermittent test-setup timing. **⇒ Bug B is ENTIRELY test-only** (guard/apply-path sound). Fix = realign `wb-e2-apply-remote-pdf-stroke-leak.spec.ts` (Composer, test-only: inject during fingerprint window / drop mistimed steady-state L159 check). **1 STALE ORACLE** (test-only): **`wb-wave5-polish` item13 #20** — expects `/live/i` but product correctly shows **"Solo rehearsal"** during solo grace (verified vs `lifecycle-machine.ts:627` + its unit test); oracle should assert "Solo rehearsal"/"Recording". **3 ENVIRONMENTAL** (pass in isolation): #1 audio-upload dropzone, #3 review-overlay roster-VAD, #9 wb-end-from-roster `endedAt`. **⇒ FINAL tally of 22 relay reds: exactly 1 REAL product bug (A, mute-gain — branch-only WS-I gap, confirmed [81813fa3]); Bug B = test-only (L159 stale oracle + L146 test-timing, guard proven sound 3/3); stale oracle #20 FIXED (`0118359`); ~18 environmental (marathon exhaustion).** Net: the relay-unblock surfaced ONE genuine product defect (WS-I pre-start mute), and it's not on master. |
| **Next action(s)** | **✅ F2a DONE (`13c7522`).** **🎯 IMMEDIATE — F2b, Andrew approved attended-run 2026-07-07 (do this first in the fresh chat):** run the first live sharded relay validation. Command: `npm run test:wb-sync` (or `node scripts/wb-relay-shard-run.cjs`; run `node scripts/wb-relay-shard-run.cjs --manifest-only` first to eyeball the 6-shard split). **Preconditions:** Docker relay :3002 + Postgres :5432 UP; **NEVER free/kill :3002** (only :3100/:3101). **Watch for:** (a) each shard gets a FRESH :3100 dev server (proves no marathon exhaustion — the whole point), (b) isolation re-run classifies REAL-FAIL vs ENV-FLAKE correctly, (c) **blob-output caveat** — if `merge-reports` finds no zips, fix the per-shard blob env-var names (`PLAYWRIGHT_BLOB_OUTPUT_DIR/NAME`) in `wb-relay-shard-run.cjs`; the gate VERDICT (shard exit + isolation) is unaffected. **Expected 1 real red:** `wb-tutor-recording-mute` (Bug A, WS-I pre-start mute). **Then F3 (Bug B — apply-remote spec realignment; author + red→green IN this same relay session, test-only, Composer)** → then **Bug A** (fragile; plan-mode → Sonnet 5-axis → fix; Andrew GO given; green `wb-tutor-recording-mute.spec.ts` = merge bar) → then **Tranche E** (P2-WB-2 → P3-J1..5). **F1 jest-isolation-class-2:** heavy straggler-elimination pass **DEFERRED** (tracked in BACKLOG + GATE/HARNESS § (f)); correct fix = await/mock all fire-and-forget DB paths across ~45 integration suites, THEN per-suite/per-test cleanup works; medium alt = scoped `afterAll` on aggressive-deleter suites only (`note-and-share.test.ts`, erasure-lifecycle, student-crud cascade deletes). **Merge-gate jest:** `--workers=1` + retry; any RED must be re-run in isolation and classified per standing doctrine rule (6) before merge. **Still owed pre-master (gated):** Bug A WS-I pre-start mute fix (Andrew go; fragile surface), Bug B apply-remote spec realignment (test-only), A4 WS-X relay red/green (deferred), WS-T #9 outbox self-heal (design-first), Tranche C WS-G-A poll.

| **Open Andrew-confirms** | Known-issues in-app page [`89d8d02`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/89d8d02) — **tone/copy sign-off** + remaining content calls (WS-I/WS-N inclusion, WS-O minor-ness). **RESOLVED 2026-07-05:** WS-G concat-lag → **OMIT** from the Sarah-facing page. **Governing principle (Andrew):** *don't call attention to a transient unless it's a bug we intend to fix* (concat-lag is being fixed by WS-G-A → not a standing issue → omit). **WS-U13-a likely MOOT:** in-person fix `3bf3a7e` starts recording on Start w/o a peer, so in-person no longer sits in `awaiting_first_participant` → the "Waiting for your student…" copy WS-U13-a targeted is unreachable for in-person (confirm-and-close, not pick-wording). **WS-P O3 (FYI):** `endingState==="error"` keeps deferring reload; unmount clears — flag if disagree.

Spec (authored WITH `ef5fb1a`) dropped WIP `5d80ea8`'s pre-armed `releaseGuard`-synchronous injection for post-import `page.evaluate` which can't observe an active fingerprint. Realign: restore synchronous-injection timing / add `__WBX_ON_GUARD_RELEASE__` seam; split steady-state oracle into `wb-e2-pdf-stroke-leak.spec.ts`. **(2) L146 ~60% SEPARATE onChange-path leak** (live board-3 `line` on PDF board pre-injection, NOT tombstone artifact — `getSceneElements()` excludes deleted) — orthogonal to fix (a); if real = genuine BUG-3 recurrence → needs own instrumented steady-state run. **WS-X = most fragile surface + multi-attempt history → NO blind 3rd fix; both parts = attended + careful (Andrew + Sonnet on any product seam).** **🅿️ DEFERRED per Andrew 2026-07-05 to a dedicated attended session / design pass** (order: instrumented steady-state run to settle the L146 onChange-leak question FIRST → then realign the apply-remote spec to actually prove fix (a)). **§6 WS-X proof NOT discharged; WS-X NOT proven.** |

**Autonomy posture (2026-07-05):** **LIMITED** — proceed unattended only on safe non-fragile work (jest-isolation, state/docs, pure-jest batches). **Park** anything fragile/gated for Andrew.

**Andrew decisions ledger (2026-07-06):** approved Tranche E → then chose fix+baseline → then harden-now → then root-cause-both-bugs → then swap → **(post-swap) approved Tranche F infra-first:** F1 jest-isolation-2 → F2 relay-shards → F3 Bug B (test-only); **Bug A = GO** with plan-mode design → Sonnet 5-axis → fix (green `wb-tutor-recording-mute.spec.ts` = merge bar); then resume Tranche E (P2-WB-2 → P3). **F1 scope decision (Andrew, Option A):** salvage good test-only fix(es), revert truncate, **DEFER** heavy jest-isolation as tracked debt, keep merge-gate jest at `--workers=1`+retry → **F2 relay-shards** then Tranche E. **(2026-07-07) F2a built+committed+pushed (`13c7522`, orchestrator-reviewed); Andrew approved: run the attended sharded `test:wb-sync` validation NOW (F2b) + swap to a fresh chat.** F2b is conductor-tier Composer/Sonnet (known-loop attended validation, not Opus).

**✅ F1 RESOLVED-via-defer (2026-07-06, post-swap) — global per-test TRUNCATE mechanism FAILED; Andrew chose Option A.** Diagnosis ([b638f945](b638f945-7db5-4ac6-88f0-c3c3a93a3497)) recommended a global `afterEach` `TRUNCATE ... CASCADE` on `tutoring_notes_test`; implementation produced **~40 failed suites/run × 3** consecutive `jest --workers=1` runs (vs ~1-flake baseline) — `40P01` deadlocks + FK/"Engine is not yet connected" races. **Reframed root cause:** TRUNCATE's `AccessExclusiveLock` collides with **in-flight fire-and-forget async DB work that outlives test bodies** (same stragglers as `Cannot log after tests are done` + `CostEvent_..._fkey` leaks) → *any* between-test cleanup races them. **Correct fix (deferred):** eliminate stragglers (await/mock all fire-and-forget DB paths across ~45 integration suites), THEN simple per-suite/per-test cleanup works. **Medium alt:** scoped per-suite `afterAll` on aggressive-deleter suites only (`note-and-share.test.ts` unscoped `deleteMany`, erasure-lifecycle, student-crud cascade deletes). Failed attempt in `git stash@{0}` on `wb-wave5-polish` ("F1 truncate attempt (FAILED...)") — `reset-test-database.ts` + `jest.setup-db-cleanup.ts` + `jest.config.ts` wiring + `note-and-share.test.ts` cleanup removal (NOT committed). **Salvaged [`647ec35`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/647ec35):** transcription-worker extract-chunk mock + microtask flush only. **Dropped:** upload-outbox observation-timing (5000ms wait = Jest timeout; T1+S1 never appeared; not shippable). Baseline restored; tree clean @ [`647ec35`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/647ec35).

**Worktree discipline:** execute on **`tutoring-notes-polishwt`** / **`wb-wave5-polish`**. Default checkout `tutoring-notes` is on `v1-redesign` — do not use it for wave-5 work.

**Wave-5 queue (authoritative backlog):** [`wb-wave5-execution-queue.md`](wb-wave5-execution-queue.md). **Andrew's smoke results:** [`go-to-sarah-master-cut-smokebook.md`](go-to-sarah-master-cut-smokebook.md) (do not edit).

## Project arc + North Star

Pre-public pilot with one tutor (Sarah). North Star from [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md): *"People need to use the app with confidence. Sarah is being patient, but that won't last forever."* Reliability bar: [`../../agenticPipeline/.cursor/rules/reliability-bar.mdc`](../../agenticPipeline/.cursor/rules/reliability-bar.mdc).

**Strategic posture:** Experience-driven wedge — WB + reliability = ground floor (GATE); the win = accreting honest tutor-first continuity. [`experience-driven_wedge_ae2776e1.plan.md`](../../../../.cursor/plans/experience-driven_wedge_ae2776e1.plan.md).

**Active execution:** **go-to-Sarah master-cut** on `wb-wave5-polish` — durability pillars WS-A..D landed; P1/P2 fix trains largely complete; fragile-fix train done; parked at **merge gate** for Andrew hardware re-smoke + relay proofs. **Ship-to-Sarah gate** governs cut to `v1-redesign → master` (see below).

## Fragile-fix train outcomes (durable)

### In-person audio — BACKLOG SMOKE-BLOCK-5 resolved

- **Product call (Andrew):** treat IN_PERSON like solo — start tutor mic on Start, no remote peer required.
- **Implementation [`9740b1b`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/9740b1b) + fold [`3bf3a7e`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/3bf3a7e):** additive `LifecycleInputs.inPersonMode?` + step-3b in `lifecycle-machine.ts` (after `!syncEnabled`, before `!networkOk`); `derivePresentation` guard; two WWC call-site lines. **No engine rewrite.**
- **Teeth:** 4 jest units (authoritative); Playwright `wb-in-person-audio-start.spec.ts` in **`wb-in-person-unmasked`** project (port 3101, no solo env flag) — **not** `wb-regression` (solo flag masks → synthetic green).
- **5-axis:** SHIP-WITH-FIXES; SHOULD-FIXes folded (`clock_start` log `mode=`, spec enrollment fix).
- **Owed:** relay run for `wb-in-person-unmasked` at attended merge boundary.

### WS-X BUG-3 — PDF stroke leak resolved

- **Root cause:** stale scene merged via `applyRemoteToCanvas` during post-page-switch fingerprint window; v3 broadcast tombstone rebroadcast class (filter-isDeleted on broadcast was **rejected** — breaks erasure propagation).
- **Fix [`ef5fb1a`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/ef5fb1a):** additive guard — `onTargetReadTime` also requires `!pageSceneSetFingerprintRef.current.has(targetId)` → falls back to clean `pageDataRef[targetId]` during window. Prerequisite infra from WIP branch (`pageSceneSetFingerprintRef`, stale-onChange rejection). **No v3 broadcast filter change.**
- **Teeth:** `wb-e2-apply-remote-pdf-stroke-leak.spec.ts` + `__WBX_*` seams (prod-inert double-gate).
- **5-axis:** **CLEAN** — no over-suppression; tombstone/erase path unchanged.
- **Owed:** relay red/green at attended `test:wb-sync`.

**Serialize rule preserved:** in-person, WS-X, and WS-P deliverable-2 all touch WWC — never two code-writers at once.

---

## Settled Andrew decisions (2026-07-05)

Resolved FOR-ANDREW batch — treat as facts, not open questions:

| Topic | Resolution |
|---|---|
| **IN_PERSON audio** | Start recording on Start without remote peer (`inPersonMode` boolean; LIVE→IN_PERSON mid-session toggle N/A — mode fixed at creation) |
| **WS-K/G tuning** | No pre-flush; 5-chunk/2min debounce; full reduce; libopus re-encode; cap 400; duration free-ride |
| **WS-G-A** | **POLL** — "preparing seamless replay…" when concat ready (follow-up, not blocking core) |
| **WS-N4** | Defaults ratified; NO concurrent-tab End-block |
| **WS-J** | Nearest/5 + `America/Denver`; IN_PERSON wall-elapsed incl. pauses; ≥1-increment min; prod migration apply = merge HARD STOP |
| **WS-P-A/B** | Tutor-only defer; read-only-of-FSM `useEffect` in WWC approved → deliverable 2 unblocked |
| **WS-X** | Fix (a) fingerprint-guard approved (filter-isDeleted reversal accepted) — **shipped `ef5fb1a`** |
| **Known-issues** | IN-APP (Help/Settings); internal WS-* appendix excluded |
| **`.env` → preview-dev** | Informational; prod verified clean for WS-K/G/J migrations |

## Merge-gate items owed (before master)

1. **`npm run test:wb-sync`** once on integrated tip — branch cumulatively touches whiteboard/apply-adjacent surfaces. **Component proofs (2026-07-06):** A2 WS-P defer-reload seam ✅ **DISCHARGED** (committed [`4b085db`](https://github.com/Arangarx/tutoring-notes/commit/4b085db)); in-person `wb-in-person-unmasked` ✅ **PROVEN** (A3); **WS-X `wb-e2-apply-remote-pdf-stroke-leak` ❌ RED (A4) — deferred, NOT proven**. Full-suite `test:wb-sync` still owed on integrated tip.
2. ~~**`npx next build`** — build-surface touched (`next.config.ts` WS-P).~~ **✅ DISCHARGED 2026-07-05** — exit 0 on code-tip `2c7a7bd`/`21378c9` (no TS/ESLint errors; `/api/version` + `/admin/settings/billing` present). Re-run only if the tip advances with further build-surface edits.
3. **WS-M** — two-device real-hardware A/V smoke (jsdom cannot verify tutor hears student).
4. **WS-A F-1** — outbox register attempt cap (~10 lines) + own 5-axis (SHOULD-FIX deferred from `234c6d7` review).
5. **Migrations** — WS-K/G/J additive nullable authored; applied on preview-dev only; **prod apply = Andrew greenlight** at cut.
6. **Andrew hardware re-smoke** — master-cut smokebook [`go-to-sarah-master-cut-smokebook.md`](go-to-sarah-master-cut-smokebook.md).

**HARD STOPS:** merge to master; Neon/prod migrations; account reset; force-push.

**Harness note:** Playwright workers 14→4 recommended (contention resolved at w=4 on `c2ca8f5`); not yet applied to config.

## Ship-to-Sarah gate (governing)

Andrew wants Sarah on `v1-redesign` once waiting room → WB → end is stable for tutor **and** student — backend pipeline included. Capture: [`sarah-pilot-feedback-2026-06-16-orchestrator-report.md`](sarah-pilot-feedback-2026-06-16-orchestrator-report.md).

**Confirmed gate items:** per-chunk notes only (no legacy monolithic); End/Continue never silently deletes recording; single-segment seek at every review entry; consent UI honesty (`CONSENT-HONESTY-SARAH-MERGE-BLOCKER`). Deferral ledger: [`pre-master-smoke-deferral-ledger-2026-06-16.md`](pre-master-smoke-deferral-ledger-2026-06-16.md).

Sarah remains on production `master` until gate passes.

## How we work (pointers)

- **Orchestration:** [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) § Model usage protocol; dispatch boundary [`.cursor/rules/orchestrator-discipline.mdc`](../../.cursor/rules/orchestrator-discipline.mdc)
- **Conductor tier:** Opus for fragile durability design + judgment; Composer 2.5 executes; Sonnet 5-axis on fragile diffs. **Fragile-serial** in one worktree.
- **Merging:** smokeable branch → Andrew smoke → `merge --no-ff`; WB sync at merge boundary; build-surface → `npx next build`
- **Smokebooks:** [`SMOKEBOOK-TEMPLATE.md`](SMOKEBOOK-TEMPLATE.md); preview URL via Vercel MCP (never guessed)
- **Process:** preview links in pairs (Vercel `branchAlias` + `preview.usemynk.com` when repointed); behavior tests to spec not code; swap chats ~60–70% context

## History / audit trail

Updated in place; `git log -p docs/handoff/ORCHESTRATOR-STATE.md`. Heavy-restructure template: [`orchestrator-state-template.md`](orchestrator-state-template.md). Commit truth: `git log --oneline -30 wb-wave5-polish`.

**2026-07-05 crash recovery (resolved):** Andrew's machine crash zeroed loose ref `refs/heads/wb-wave5-polish` (41 null bytes); recovered via reflog to `970aa18`, no committed work lost. CRLF-flip artifact on `EndedUnsavedSessionsList.tsx` later reverted; tree clean.
