/**
 * Recorder lifecycle hook for the in-browser audio capture flow.
 *
 * Owns every ref + state + side-effect that previously lived inline in
 * AudioRecordInput. The shell component is now thin — destructure this hook
 * and pick a subview based on `state`.
 *
 * Invariants preserved verbatim from the pre-refactor recorder. Do not
 * "clean up" without re-reading the comment next to each one:
 *
 *  - iOS Safari MP4 fragmentation guard: `recorder.start()` is called with
 *    NO timeslice argument. Chunked output (start(1000)) makes iOS Safari
 *    emit fragmented MP4 pieces that don't concatenate into a playable /
 *    Whisper-decodable file.
 *  - StrictMode double-mount guard: per-effect `cancelled` flag PLUS a
 *    `streamRef.current` short-circuit. Do not introduce a module-level
 *    "already attempted" ref — that pattern blocks the legitimate
 *    post-remount auto-acquire after the parent re-keys this component.
 *  - Rollover keeps the mic hot: `stopAndUpload("rollover")` skips
 *    `teardownMicStream()` until after the segment uploads (or fails).
 *    Tearing down mid-rollover prompts iOS for permission again.
 *  - The meter is driven by direct DOM writes via `meterBarRef`, never via
 *    setState. A meter that re-rendered 60×/sec would kill mid-drag slider
 *    gestures and burn CPU.
 *  - The 1s timer's auto-rollover branch is single-shot per segment via
 *    `rolloverInProgressRef`. Without it, two timer ticks at the boundary
 *    can both call `stopAndUpload("rollover")`.
 *  - Gapless rollover (B5): on auto-rollover we PRE-WARM a second
 *    MediaRecorder on the same mic stream BEFORE calling .stop() on the
 *    current one. The old recorder's chunks are snapshotted to a LOCAL
 *    array and its ondataavailable handler is rebound to push into that
 *    local — otherwise the late "final flush" dataavailable that fires on
 *    .stop() would land in the NEW recorder's chunksRef and corrupt the
 *    next segment. Without the pre-warm there is a ~3-5s silent gap
 *    while the browser finalizes the WebM/MP4 container (this was
 *    Sarah's "4-second cutoff between recordings" report).
