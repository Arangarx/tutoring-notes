/**
 * Whiteboard recorder hook — the spine of the Phase 1 whiteboard.
 *
 * Composes with `useAudioRecorder` (the workspace component owns that
 * one and passes us `getAudioMs` + `recordingActive`) to produce a
 * canonical, audio-aligned `WBEventLog` that
 * `WhiteboardReplay` can play back in lockstep with the audio.
 *
 * Plan responsibilities folded in here (do NOT remove without re-reading
 * the plan blockers each invariant addresses):
 *
 *   1. **Audio-clock t** (plan blocker #2): every event's `t` field
 *      is `getAudioMs()`, never `Date.now()`. The audio clock pauses
 *      when the recorder pauses, freezes when MediaRecorder is
 *      throttled by an iOS background tab, and resumes monotonic on
 *      foreground-return — exactly the timing replay needs.
 *
 *   2. **recordingActive gate** (plan blocker #4 — pause race):
 *      while `recordingActive=false` we do NOT append scene-diff events
 *      to the log. The tutor can still draw (and use Insert PDF/image)
 *      before Start — those edits do not log until recording begins.
 *      Live **sync** still broadcasts the latest scene on every flush so
 *      the join link always reflects the canvas; only the event log is
 *      gated. On the false → true transition we emit a `snapshot` so
 *      the recording starts from the visible state, not a blank canvas.
 *
 *   3. **Diff via adapter** (plan blocker #3 — < 500 KB events):
 *      `Excalidraw.onChange` fires for every cursor move; we throttle
 *      to ~one diff every `DIFF_INTERVAL_MS` and use
 *      `diffScenes()` to emit only add / update / remove deltas.
 *      Full snapshots only at start and after pause/resume.
 *
 *   4. **ingestRemote** (live sync from student): the sync client
 *      hands us `(peerId, elements)` whenever the student emits a
 *      scene update. We canonicalise, tag clientId, and run the
 *      same diff path — student strokes land in the log with their
 *      author tag so replay can colour them differently.
 *
 *   5. **IndexedDB checkpoint** (plan blocker #1 — crash recovery):
 *      every `IDB_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL_MS` (default 30 s) and on
 *      visibilitychange (visible → hidden) we flush the WBEventLog
 *      to IndexedDB. On reload of the workspace for the same tutor
 *      we surface a "Resume" prompt.
 *
 *   6. **visibilitychange + sync markers**: the log carries
 *      `tab-hidden` / `tab-visible` / `sync-disconnect` /
 *      `sync-reconnect` markers as DEBUG breadcrumbs. They never
 *      affect scene reconstruction but help us reason about
 *      mid-session anomalies after the fact.
 *
 *   7. **Resume from crash**: on mount we call
 *      `findCheckpoint("whiteboard", ownerKey)` for THIS session id
 *      only. A brand-new session URL must start with a blank board —
 *      cross-session recovery is via that session's own URL, not by
 *      importing another session's IndexedDB row. Stale rows for ended
 *      sessions are garbage-collected silently on mount.
 *
 *   8. **wbsid logging**: every console line is tagged
 *      `[useWhiteboardRecorder] wbsid=<sessionId> ...` to mirror the
 *      `rid=` correlation we use server-side.
 *
 * Failure-mode contract: this hook NEVER throws into a React render.
 * Every async path returns a structured result; recoverable errors
 * surface via `checkpointStatus / checkpointError` so the workspace
 * can decide whether to interrupt the tutor.
 *
 * What lives elsewhere (deliberate split):
 *   - The MediaRecorder + mic graph + meter:           useAudioRecorder
 *   - The WS protocol + welcome packet + reconnect:    sync-client.ts
 *   - The blob upload (`/api/upload/blob`):            workspace page
 *   - The Excalidraw <Excalidraw /> render:            workspace page
 *   - The replay player:                               WhiteboardReplay
 *
 * That split keeps each surface small enough to verify in isolation.
 * If you find yourself reaching out to MediaRecorder or fetch() from
 * inside this file, stop and reconsider.
