/**
 * Regression test for src/app/api/upload/blob/route.ts.
 *
 * Background: client-direct uploads to Vercel Blob (the @vercel/blob/client
 * `upload()` flow) sign a single-use token via our handleUpload route. If
 * `onUploadCompleted` is passed to handleUpload, Vercel's helper tries to
 * embed a callbackUrl in the token. On localhost there is no callbackUrl
 * to determine (no VERCEL=1 and usually no VERCEL_BLOB_CALLBACK_URL) — the
 * token is signed with onUploadCompleted: undefined, and Vercel's edge
 * then 400s the actual PUT because the request / token handshake doesn't
 * reconcile cleanly. Sarah's smoke #2 hung on exactly this for ~30s of
 * "Uploading recording..." before erroring out.
 *
 * The fix is to NOT pass onUploadCompleted at all. We don't need it —
 * the recording row is written by the caller once it learns result.url.
 * If you ever need post-upload server-side work, see the route file
 * header comment for how to do it without breaking local dev.
 *
 * If you re-add onUploadCompleted to this route, you MUST also document
 * how local-dev users should set VERCEL_BLOB_CALLBACK_URL (or use the
 * preview URL) — and update this test to permit it.
