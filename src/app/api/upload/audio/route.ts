/**
 * Client-direct Vercel Blob upload route.
 *
 * Why this exists: the previous flow (uploadAudioAction server action)
 * routed every audio blob through a Vercel server function, which caps
 * request bodies at 4.5MB. Sarah hit that ceiling uploading a 17.9MB,
 * ~30-minute m4a file from her phone and got a generic "unexpected
 * response from the server" error. With handleUpload + the client-side
 * upload() helper, the browser PUTs straight to Vercel Blob and our
 * function only sees a tiny token-mint request, so the size cap is
 * effectively the BLOB_MAX_BYTES constant we set ourselves (100MB
 * today; can grow to 5TB).
 *
 * Token-mint only — no completion callback. We deliberately do NOT
 * pass onUploadCompleted to handleUpload, for two reasons:
 *
 *  1. We don't need it. The recording row is written by the caller
 *     (recorder hook / Upload tab) once the client side learns the
 *     final blob URL from upload()'s return value, then a separate
 *     server action (createRecording / transcribeAndGenerate) writes
 *     the DB row. There is nothing to do in onUploadCompleted.
 *
 *  2. It breaks local dev. When onUploadCompleted is present, Vercel's
 *     handleUpload tries to embed a callbackUrl in the signed client
 *     token. On localhost (no VERCEL=1 and no VERCEL_BLOB_CALLBACK_URL),
 *     getCallbackUrl() returns undefined and the token is signed with
 *     onUploadCompleted: undefined. Vercel's edge then 400s the PUT
 *     because the token / request handshake doesn't reconcile cleanly.
 *     Removing the callback altogether sidesteps this — local dev,
 *     preview, and prod all behave the same way.
 *
 * If we ever need post-upload server-side work (virus scan, transcode,
 * size accounting), reintroduce onUploadCompleted AND set
 * VERCEL_BLOB_CALLBACK_URL to a tunnel URL (ngrok / cloudflared) when
 * developing locally.
 *
 * Auth model: ownership check happens inside onBeforeGenerateToken.
 * Token issuance is the actual gate — without a valid token signed for
 * this pathname, the PUT can't happen.
