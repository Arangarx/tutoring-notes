 * Terms of Service — Tutoring Notes (product subordinate facade).
 *
 * SYNCED FROM https://www.mortensenapps.com/terms as of 2026-05-31.
 * Product-specific COPPA cross-reference updated 2026-07-09 (SEC-POLICY-TRUTH interim).
 *
 * The Mortensen Apps umbrella terms at www.mortensenapps.com/terms are
 * the CANONICAL legal source for eligibility / acceptable use /
 * disclaimers / limitation of liability (incl. the $50 dollar cap) /
 * indemnity / governing law, and the URL registered in the shared
 * "Mortensen Apps" OAuth consent screen Tutoring Notes uses (confirmed
 * from Google Cloud Console 2026-05-17). This file is a local
 * subordinate facade that embeds those sections verbatim and layers
 * product-specific sections on top — Your content, Gmail integration
 * specifics, Availability. The in-UI preamble paragraph on this page
 * explicitly tells readers the umbrella governs. This URL is NOT
 * registered with Google as a policy URL for the OAuth client.
 *
 * MAINTENANCE: when www.mortensenapps.com/terms changes, update the
 * embedded sections here verbatim from the upstream + bump the "Last
 * updated" date + bump the SYNCED FROM date above. See
 * docs/LEGAL-SYNC.md for the sync protocol and the per-section
 * umbrella-vs-product classification table.

            <p style={{ margin: "8px 0 0" }}>
              Tutoring Notes is a web application that helps tutors record session
              audio, draft notes, run a shared whiteboard, and share read-only updates
              with students and parents.

            <h2 className="heading m-0 text-lg font-normal">Eligibility and accounts</h2>
            <p style={{ margin: "8px 0 0" }}>
              You must be able to form a binding contract and, where applicable, have
              permission from your organization to use the service. You are responsible
              for safeguarding your account credentials and for activity under your
              account. You must not share your account with others.

            <h2 className="heading m-0 text-lg font-normal">Acceptable use</h2>
            <p style={{ margin: "8px 0 0" }}>You agree not to:</p>
            <ul style={{ margin: "8px 0 0", paddingLeft: 20, lineHeight: 1.7 }}>
              <li>Use the service to violate law or third-party rights.</li>
              <li>Attempt to access data or systems you are not authorized to use.</li>
              <li>Interfere with or disrupt the service or its infrastructure.</li>

              <li>Send unsolicited bulk email or deceptive messages through any integration (including Gmail).</li>
              <li>Enter student or parent information without obtaining any consent required for that data and the use you intend.</li>
              <li>Record session audio or share whiteboard / audio replays without obtaining appropriate consent, especially for sessions involving minors.</li>

            <p style={{ margin: "8px 0 0" }}>
              You retain ownership of the notes, student information, audio recordings,
              whiteboard content, and other content you enter. By using the service,
              you grant us permission to store and transmit that content as needed to
              operate the product (for example, storing notes in the database, storing
              audio in object storage, sending emails you initiate, generating share
              links you create, and processing audio through the transcription
              provider described in the privacy policy).

          </div>

          <div>
            <h2 className="heading m-0 text-lg font-normal">Gmail integration</h2>
            <p style={{ margin: "8px 0 0" }}>
              If you connect your Gmail account, the app sends emails on your behalf
              only when you explicitly click &ldquo;Send update.&rdquo; You can disconnect
              at any time from Settings → Email. Your use of Gmail is also subject to
              Google&apos;s own terms of service.

            <h2 className="heading m-0 text-lg font-normal">Third-party services</h2>
            <p style={{ margin: "8px 0 0" }}>
              The service relies on third parties (for example hosting, database, object
              storage, Google OAuth, OpenAI for transcription and note generation, and
              email delivery). Your use of those features is also subject to the third
              party&apos;s terms and policies. We are not responsible for outages or
              changes caused solely by third-party platforms. The current list of

            <p style={{ margin: "8px 0 0" }}>
              We aim to keep the service available but do not guarantee uptime.
              Features may change or be removed. We will make reasonable efforts to
              notify users of significant changes via the app or by email where
              practical.

            <h2 className="heading m-0 text-lg font-normal">Children and parental consent</h2>
            <p style={{ margin: "8px 0 0" }}>
              Tutoring Notes knowingly serves students who may be under 13 and is subject
              to the Children&rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA),
              16&nbsp;CFR Part&nbsp;312. By entering a child under 13 into the platform as
              a student, the account holder (parent or guardian) represents that they are
              that child&rsquo;s parent or legal guardian and that they have reviewed and
              consented to the privacy practices described in our{" "}
              <Link href="/privacy">privacy policy</Link>, including the collection of
              session audio recordings, transcripts, and notes.
            </p>
            <p style={{ margin: "8px 0 0" }}>
              Parents and legal guardians retain the right to review, request deletion of,
              and revoke consent for their child&rsquo;s personal information at any time.
              See the <Link href="/privacy">privacy policy</Link> — specifically the{" "}
              &ldquo;Children&rsquo;s data and parental rights (COPPA)&rdquo; section — for
              how to exercise these rights, our retention practices, and the contact address
              for deletion requests. Withdrawing consent stops future data collection; it
              does not automatically delete data already collected under prior consent.
              Deletion requests are honored upon verification.

              service. Our total liability for any claim arising out of these terms or
              the service is limited to the greater of (a) the amount you paid us for
              the service in the twelve months before the claim or (b) fifty U.S.
              dollars, if you have not paid a fee.
