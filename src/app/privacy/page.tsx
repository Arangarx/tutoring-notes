            <p style={{ margin: "8px 0 0" }}>
              Tutoring Notes is a web application that helps private tutors record session
              audio, draft session notes, run a shared whiteboard during lessons, and share
              read-only updates with students and their families.

              <li><strong>Session audio recordings</strong> when you use the Record or Upload feature (stored in Vercel Blob — see below).</li>
              <li><strong>Whiteboard session data:</strong> timestamped stroke logs, optional PDF / image inserts, and a session snapshot used for the parent replay surface.</li>

              Your data is used solely to operate the product: signing you in, storing and
              displaying notes / audio / whiteboard sessions, generating share links, and
              sending the email updates you choose to send. We do <strong>not</strong> sell
              Google user data, and we do <strong>not</strong> sell personal information to
              data brokers, advertising platforms, or cold callers.

                <strong>Google.</strong> When you connect a Google account or use Gmail
                through the app, data needed for that feature is processed by Google
                under Google&apos;s terms and your Google account settings (OAuth tokens,
                API calls to send mail you initiate, and metadata Google logs as part of
                those APIs). We do not control Google&apos;s servers; we follow Google&apos;s
                applicable API and limited-use requirements for data we receive from
                Google APIs.

                <strong>People you direct us to contact.</strong> When you send an
                email or share content from the app (for example a session update to a
                parent&apos;s address), the recipient receives the information you chose

              </li>

                <strong>Legal and safety.</strong> We may disclose information if

              When you click &ldquo;Connect Gmail,&rdquo; the app requests permission to send

              (<code>gmail.send</code> scope) and to read your email address{" "}
              (<code>userinfo.email</code> scope). These permissions are used exclusively
              to send session-update emails from your Gmail account when you click
              &ldquo;Send update&rdquo; in the app. We do <strong>not</strong> read, search,
              index, modify, or delete any of your existing emails. Google user data we
              receive through Gmail APIs is used only to provide the user-facing email-

            <p style={{ margin: "8px 0 0" }}>
              We store a refresh token so the app can send on your behalf without asking
              you to sign in each time. OAuth tokens and related credentials are kept in
              server-side configuration or secure database storage, never embedded in
              web pages or public repositories. You can disconnect Gmail at any time
              from Settings → Email, which deletes the stored token; you can also revoke
              access directly from your Google Account security settings.

              OpenAI acts as a subprocessor operating under a data processing agreement
              on our instructions; child audio is <strong>not used to train</strong>{" "}
              OpenAI&rsquo;s models. Session data is stored in{" "}
              <strong>Vercel Blob</strong> (audio files) and{" "}
              <strong>Neon</strong> (database records), both US-region. No children&rsquo;s
              personal information is shared with any other third party.

              <strong>How we use children&rsquo;s personal information.</strong> Children&rsquo;s
              personal information is used exclusively to: deliver the tutoring session
              recording, transcription, and note-generation service; enable the tutor to
              review session history and track the student&rsquo;s progress; and (with
              parental consent) allow the parent or guardian to review session content
              through a tokenized, revocable share link. We do not use children&rsquo;s
              personal information for advertising, profiling, or any purpose unrelated
              to the child&rsquo;s tutoring sessions.
            </p>

            <p style={{ margin: "8px 0 0" }}>
              <strong>Retention (COPPA §312.10).</strong> Session audio recordings,
              transcripts, and notes, together with LearnerProfile information (name) and
              parent contact information, are retained for the duration of the active
              tutor–student relationship while your account remains in use. We may keep
              session history for a reasonable period after tutoring ends so tutors and
              parents can review progress.{" "}
              <strong>We do not retain children&rsquo;s personal information
              indefinitely.</strong> Verified deletion requests from a parent or legal
              guardian are honored promptly (see Parental rights below). Automated
              retention schedules may be introduced in the future; this policy will be
              updated when they take effect.

              <strong>Parental rights.</strong> As a parent or legal guardian, you have

              <li>Revoke consent and refuse to permit further collection or use of your

              <strong>Consent revocation and data already collected (two tracks).</strong>{" "}
              Session audio recordings, transcripts, and notes are created only with a
              parent or guardian&rsquo;s consent. Withdrawing consent stops future
              recording; it does not automatically delete content already created under
              your prior consent. As a parent or legal guardian, you may request to
              review or delete your child&rsquo;s personal information at any time by
              contacting us at{" "}
              <a href="mailto:arangarx+tutoringnotes@gmail.com">arangarx+tutoringnotes@gmail.com</a>.
              We honor verified requests as required by the Children&rsquo;s Online
              Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

            <p style={{ margin: "8px 0 0" }}>
              <strong>Educational use by the tutor.</strong> With parental consent, a
              child&rsquo;s session recordings, transcripts, and notes may be used by
              the tutor for educational purposes directly related to that child&rsquo;s
              instruction — for example, reviewing past sessions to plan future lessons or
              identifying recurring learning gaps. This consent is part of the account
              setup and is revocable going forward: revoking it stops future access for
              those purposes and the tutor is notified. Content already made available
              to the tutor under prior consent is not automatically retracted on
              revocation; you may request deletion of specific content separately.
