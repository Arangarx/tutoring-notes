/**
 * Pure helper for shaping the result of `transcribeAndGenerateAction`.
 *
 * Lives in its own non-server module because Next.js requires every export
 * from a `"use server"` file to be an async server action. The helper is
 * synchronous and pure, so it cannot live in `actions.ts`.
 *
 * Sarah's bug: previously, both the empty-transcript and gen-failure branches
 * of the action returned `ok:true` with empty fields, so the panel said
 * "Form filled" with nothing in the form. The server action may also return
 * `ok:false` before this helper when obvious Whisper junk is detected after an
 * all-empty LLM response (late guard in `actions.ts`). This helper now:
 *   - empty transcript            -> ok:false with actionable error
 *   - AI gen errors / all-empty   -> ok:true with raw transcript in `topics`
 *                                    + a `warning` so the tutor can hand-edit
 *   - happy path                  -> ok:true with structured fields, no warning
 *
 * Covered by `src/__tests__/regressions/transcribe-result-shape.test.ts`.
