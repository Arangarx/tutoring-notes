/**
 * 2FA Management Page — Identity Phase 1.
 *
 * Canonical entry for all 2FA settings. Routes server-side by enrollment state:
 *
 *   Not enrolled (no DB row):
 *     → Show setup/enroll form.
 *
 *   Enrolled but UNCONFIRMED (row exists, 0 backup codes = interrupted enrollment):
 *     → Show setup/enroll form — allow fresh QR generation. Closes p1-reenroll-trap:
 *       the old /setup page would redirect interrupted users to /verify which they
 *       could never complete since no confirmed secret existed.
 *
 *   Enrolled + confirmed, session NOT 2FA-verified:
 *     → Redirect to /verify (unchanged gate behavior).
 *
 *   Enrolled + confirmed + session verified:
 *     → Show management view (status, rotate, regen backup codes, admin reset).
 *
 * The management view replaces the blunt b4c439d redirect to /admin.
 * Post-login flow is PRESERVED: after /verify the callbackUrl or /admin is used,
 * not this page. The "Continue to dashboard" button in TwoFactorSetupForm still
 * goes to /admin. This page is only reached by explicit Settings navigation.
