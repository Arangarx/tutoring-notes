/**
 * Audio segment upload helper with retry-once semantics.
 *
 * Two related responsibilities live here:
 *
 *  1. The retry policy (uploadAudioWithRetry). One retry, never more.
 *     Real-world failure mode: a transient Vercel Blob 5xx or a flaky
 *     mobile data hop. A second attempt almost always succeeds. We
 *     deliberately do NOT retry more than once — if both attempts fail
 *     we surface the error so the tutor can switch to the Upload tab
 *     while the audio is still in browser memory.
 *
 *  2. The default uploader (uploadAudioDirect). Browser → Vercel Blob
 *     directly via @vercel/blob/client.upload(), routed through our
 *     handleUpload route handler at /api/upload/audio. This bypasses
 *     Vercel server functions' 4.5MB request body cap (which is what
 *     made Sarah's 17.9MB m4a fail with "unexpected response from the
 *     server"). The route handler enforces auth + ownership before
 *     signing the upload token; see app/api/upload/audio/route.ts.
 *
 * Tests: see __tests__/recording/upload.test.ts. The retry policy is
 * exercised against an injected stub uploader so we don't need to spin
 * up Vercel Blob during unit tests.
