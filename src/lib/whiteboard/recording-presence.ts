/**
 * Derive recording state from the tutor's intent + student presence.
 *
 * Sarah (Apr 2026 pilot feedback): "I don't think the recording needs
 * to keep going if the student isn't connected. And it should pop up
 * with a message saying student has disconnected ... and recording
 * has paused. That way I know when it happens I can pause my
 * instruction."
 *
 * The contract this function encodes:
 *
 *   - `userWantsRecording` is the tutor's button-press intent. Manual
 *     pause clears it; manual start sets it.
 *   - `bothPresent` is the live overlap signal (tutor socket up AND
 *     student peer in the room). The workspace computes this from
 *     `sync-client.peerCount`.
 *   - `recordingActive` (the value passed to the recorder hook + audio
 *     gate) is `userWantsRecording && bothPresent`. So when the
 *     student drops, the recorder sees the same `recordingActive=false`
 *     transition it would see for a manual pause — it flushes the
 *     pending diff and emits a `pause` event for replay. When the
 *     student returns, recording auto-resumes (the recorder hook also
 *     handles that transition and emits `resume`).
 *   - `autoPaused` distinguishes the auto-pause case from the manual
 *     pause case so the UI can render the right banner / pill copy.
 *     (`autoPaused === true` → tutor wanted to record but student is
 *     missing.)
 *   - `awaitingStart` covers the "tutor pressed Start before student
 *     joined" sub-case: same auto-pause state, but the right banner
 *     copy is "we'll start recording when the student joins" rather
 *     than "recording paused — student dropped".
 *
 * Tutor-solo mode (no live-sync URL configured) bypasses the gate
 * entirely — `bothPresent` is irrelevant when there's no student
 * link, and the tutor should be able to record review notes solo.
